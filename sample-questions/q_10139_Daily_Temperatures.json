      "Given a list of daily {{ temperatures }}, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put {{ 0 }} instead.",

          "For example, the answer for the 6-th index is 1, because on the 7-th day you have a warmer temperature of 76."
